Hello world!

This could be a simple text file. Ugly but useful.

However, where going to use something a bit nicer: Markdown.

Here's a short intro to Markdown. (By the way, Markdown is a wordplay on markup â€“ HTML is called a markup language)

# Markdown

## You can write headers

If you prefix a line with any number of "#" characters, it will become a header (the level will correspond to the number of "#" characters).

## You can write bullet lists

- a bullet
- another bullet
- yet another bullet
    - a nested bullet
    - another nested bullet
        - 3rd level bullet

## You can also write numbered lists

1. one
2. two
3. three
    1. abc
    2. def
    3. ghi

## You can also do some basic styling

You like italic? Here's *some italic*. You like bold? **Piece of cake**! What about strikethrough? ~~Here's some strikethrough text~~.
